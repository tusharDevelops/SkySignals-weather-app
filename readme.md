# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

## Overview

This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data for the user's current location as well as any location they input. The app integrates an external weather API to display real-time weather conditions and applies conditional styling based on the weather, all through DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Features

Current Location Weather: Automatically fetches and displays weather based on the user's current geographical location using the browser's Geolocation API.
Search for Any City: Allows users to enter a city name to get the current weather conditions of that specific location.
Weather Conditions: Displays temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.
Dynamic Backgrounds: The app changes the background color or image based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and adjusts according to screen sizes.
## Learning Objectives

This project is intended to help you learn the following:

How to fetch and integrate data from a weather API in a web project.
Handling geolocation with the browser's Geolocation API.
Using JavaScript for conditional DOM manipulation.
Styling elements dynamically based on API responses.
Basic use of HTML and CSS for a structured and styled interface.
## Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the web page.
CSS3: For styling and making the app responsive.
JavaScript (ES6): For making API calls, geolocation handling, and DOM manipulation.
Weather API: This project uses a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to fetch weather data.
Geolocation API: To get the user's current location.
